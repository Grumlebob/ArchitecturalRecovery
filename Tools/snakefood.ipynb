    "- Ensure that the Python environment used by VSCode includes the Scripts directory in your PATH so that commands like `sfood` are recognized.\n",
    "- Make sure Graphviz is installed on your system (download from [graphviz.org](https://graphviz.org/download/)) and its bin directory is added to your PATH.\n",
    "- This notebook uses Python code to display file contents (instead of relying on Unix commands) to ensure compatibility on Windows."

    "The generated dependency graphs provide a **module view** of the system. From these graphs, you can extract insights such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Module Isolation:** Identify clusters of modules that are tightly coupled internally but loosely coupled with others (potential subsystems).\n",
    "- **Cyclic Dependencies:** Detect cycles that can indicate areas needing refactoring to reduce maintenance challenges.\n",
    "- **Critical Modules:** Spot central modules with many dependencies that may require careful management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations for Reengineering\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decoupling:** Consider introducing interfaces or service layers to reduce cyclic dependencies and improve separation of concerns.\n",
    "- **Refactoring:** Break down large or complex modules into smaller, more manageable components.\n",
    "- **Documentation:** Use these dependency graphs as visual aids to document the architecture and help onboard new developers."

    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Snakefood to perform a static analysis of the Zeeguu system. By generating and visualizing dependency graphs for both the API and Frontend, you obtain a clear architectural view that can serve as a basis for further analysis and reengineering.\n",

    "The approach here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracts and visualizes architectural views from both code bases.\n",
    "- Provides insights into module cohesion, coupling, and potential cyclic dependencies.\n",
    "- Offers recommendations for reengineering based on the recovered architecture."

    "- **Snakefood Commands:**\n",
    "  - For Zeeguu-API:\n",
    "    - `sfood Data/api > api.sfood`\n",

    "    - `sfood-depgraph -f dot frontend.sfood > frontend.dot`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualization:**\n",
    "  - Python is used to read the DOT files and the `graphviz` package renders the dependency graphs.\n",
